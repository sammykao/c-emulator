# CPU Emulator

This repository contains a CPU emulator written in C and an accompanying assembly language program. The emulator simulates a simple CPU architecture and can execute programs written in the custom assembly language provided.

## Features

- Emulates a simple CPU with basic instruction set
- Supports arithmetic, logic, and control flow operations
- Includes a custom assembler to convert assembly code into machine code
- Detailed logging for debugging and understanding program flow

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC (or any C compiler)
- Make (optional, for build automation)

### Building the Emulator

To build the emulator, navigate to the project directory and run:

```sh
make
```
